## How it works

My project takes a 2 bit binary number and evaluating if it is odd or even. 

## How to test

Use the 1 and 2 switches (labled A and B) to make a 2 bit number, and the output led(on the right) will light up if it is even, and not light up 
when it is odd

## External hardware

XOR gate, NOT gate 
LED's.
